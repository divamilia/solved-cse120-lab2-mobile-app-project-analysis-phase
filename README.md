The Software Engineering course covers techniques for dealing with the complexity of software systems. We will focus on the technology of software engineering for the individual and small team, rather than business or management issues. This Mobile App project aims to provide an opportunity for students to analyze, design, develop, and deploy a mobile app that is sponsored by an industry partner. By end of this lab, you will be able to define the parameters of the <strong>analysis phase </strong>of your mobile app project.

This phase of project aims to define the requirements of a system (your mobile app project) and how they can be accomplished. By end of this lab, you will be able to define the ontology of your project.
